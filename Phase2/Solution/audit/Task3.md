# Task 3 review

**Task done by:** Lauri Leiten, Einar Linde, Masud Rana  \
**Reviewer:** Masud Rana \
**Was the stated problem/task solved in an acceptable manner?** \
The task is to document implemented services for BuildIT (HTTP), ReBuildIT (Websocket), and DestroyIT (gRPC) so that they can be understandable to the respective company's project manager and developers. To implement this task, markdown language is used. Although the document has some tiny typos, it is pretty much clean and understandable. So, it can be considered as acceptable. \
**What has been done well and why?** \
The structure of the document is sound and eye-catching.         
**What is not well implemented and why?** \
More examples can be added to understand better the use cases.  
**How easy is it to understand?** \
It is neat and straightforward documentation and easy to understand. \
**Are there any recommendations to simplify some of this task that the reviewer would like to share?** \
godoc can be used to generate the skeleton of the documentation and later use manual effort to finalize it. Although we might need to remove most of the autogenerated texts. \
**Anything else notable, encouraging, or funny?** \
Nothing special. It's a simple documentation task.

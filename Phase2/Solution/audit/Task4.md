# Task 4 review

**Task done by:** Einar Linde  \
**Reviewer:** Masud Rana \
**Was the stated problem/task solved in an acceptable manner?** \
The Task required to run all RentIT services with docker-compose. The task is solved by utlizing docker compose file and its pretty well organized. Firstly it builds required images to build RenIT image and then it builds test container and run test. All things perform smoothly and it passes autograding as well. So, I think task is solved in a acceptable manner. \
**What has been done well and why?** \
Docker-compose file structure is done well and it is self explanatory.  
**What is not well implemented and why?** \
Nothing seems bad with my reviewing impression.  
**How easy is it to understand?** \
It is neat and straightforward and easy to understand. \
**Are there any recommendations to simplify some of this task that the reviewer would like to share?** \
Its an staightforward implementation and no special recomendation. \
**Anything else notable, encouraging, or funny?** \
Nothing special.

## Documentation
The web project allows site engineers to submit and follow their request in the case of a need for a plant hire. 
Also, work engineers are capable of reviewing, accepting, rejecting, making orders and following those orders. 
Site engineer are capable of creating their request and checking the status of that request.
Also, if their requests are not approved yet by the work engineers it is possible for those requests to be modified. 
Work engineers, on the other hand, will be capable to review the requests made by site engineers.
Work engineers can modify the requests without any limitations.
When a order is submitted, it is possible to review and check the orders available in the system.
Our BuildIt solution also has the possibility for the site engineers to approve and reject invoices and retrieve the purchase order associated with a given invoice

## The unique feature
We decided to enable deletion of the plant hire requests associated with a specified plant supplier.
For example if we exchange supplier and the previous one doesn't want us to store their information anymore then we should delete the data connected to them.
This endpoint enables just that. \
